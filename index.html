										<h3>Hi, I'm Mia Radovanovic!</h3>
									<p> I'm a graduate student at the University of Toronto working with Dr. Jessica Sommerville in the <strong><a href="https://www.tecl.ca/"> Toronto Early Cognition Lab</a></strong>. We have limited time and effort, so our everyday actions involve trade-offs where we invest in some goals or social partners at the expense of others. My work jumps off from the observation that children are capable both of learning through their own exploration and of reasoning about others from a young age. And we've all had experiences where kids have actually outsmarted us! (like Alex on Modern Family). </p>

									<p> In many contexts, children will invest their energy in rational ways (for example, asking for help on unsolvable problems or helping less when costs are high). However, making these decisions about how to invest effort become a lot more complicated when children have to negotiate their own desires with <i>power dynamics</i>. My work is focused on understanding these puzzle pieces: How do children decide to spend their effort? What do children think about and expect from others? How do adults, social categories, and power dynamics influence children's ability to explore their own ideas and feel comfortable innovating? In doing this work, I also aim to push against implicit assumptions (e.g., Is persistence always desirable? Are adults reliable teachers?) and avoid deficit interpretations of children's behaviors.</p>
									<p></p>	
									<p> In addition to my research, I'm also passionate about teaching and undergraduate mentorship! I co-coordinate and founded the <strong><a href="https://purc.psych.utoronto.ca/">Psychology Undergraduate Research Club</a></strong>. In our weekly meetings, undergraduates learn about research, share their own work, and gain applicable skills. In our writing workshops, we help undergraduates prepare materials both for graduate school applications and for Research Opportunity Program applications. Meanwhile, on the departmental level, I work with a team to assess campus climate for undergraduates and develop suggestions for best practices.</p>
