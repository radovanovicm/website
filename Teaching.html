						<h3>PSY210 Introduction to Developmental Psychology</h3>
						<p>This is an introductory course in developmental psychology, with a focus on cognitive and social development in infancy through childhood. Example topics include early perceptual and cognitive development, agency, morality, social relationships, and the role of sociocultural context and environment in shaping development. Throughout the semester, I leverage specific insights from these topics to consider larger questions regarding the nature of human knowledge and mechanisms of change. Where appropriate, I also consider individual differences to interrogate value judgements, and make connections to relevant social issues.</p>

						<h3>PSY312 Cognitive Development</h3>
						<p>This course provides a foundational understanding of key issues in cognitive development, including language development, statistical and causal learning, social cognition, categories and concepts, and memory and executive function. In this class, students  have opportunities to learn from lectures, but also to read and discuss both classical and recent empirical and theoretical work on these topics. The course covers infancy through the early school years. Major theories of cognitive development will be explored. Emphasis is placed on thinking critically about experimental findings and their generalizability.</p>

						<h3>PSY319 Developmental Laboratory</h3>
						<p>This course is seminar-based and designed to help students develop key skills used by in developmental psychology research through hands-on practice. The course is driven by students' own interests and key skills gained by students include developing research questions and hypotheses, designing studies, conducting literature searches, collecting and interpreting data, and presenting findings. The course is designed both to show students how research in developmental psychology is conducted, and also to help students better understand their future goals.
