						<h3> How do children decide when and how to expend effort?</h3>

						<p style="margin-left:75px"> Time and energy are limited, so children can only invest their effort in a finite number of tasks. How do children decide to invest this effort? One key pillar of my work elaborates factors that shape children’s persistence both in problem-solving and social contexts. So far, we have demonstrated that <strong><a href=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2sc9m2cf>exploring more</a></strong> leads to greater persistence, but that increased task difficulty leads children to divest from tasks including helping others. Children are also sensitive to nuanced features of the feedback they receive. For example, children persist more when caregiver praise highlights the moments where their trying becomes success, but not when praise is random. Together, this work suggests that children's decisions are responsive and calibrated to a variety of even subtle features.</p>
						<h3> How do social categories and power dynamics influence children's ability to explore their own ideas and feel comfortable innovating?</h3>
						<center><img src="Independent.png" alt="Girl Thinking" width = "333" height = "199"></center>
						<p style ="margin-left:75px"> Adults are sometimes wrong, so it’s important that children aren't just copying us but instead thinking critically about teaching. However, we as adults never intend to teach children incorrect information, so in the instances where we’re wrong, we often don’t know it! Because of this, it often isn’t obvious that an adult is wrong and children have to develop skills to vet the quality of teaching and move beyond ineffective teaching. One line of my work investigates children’s ability to detect gaps in teaching and compensate for them. While infants and generally able to <strong><a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.705108>divest from ineffective demonstrations</a></strong>, making decisions about when to prioritize your own exploration becomes more complicated as children age and social dynamics compound. For instance, girls are socialized to people-please more than boys from a young age, and we find that girls are more <strong><a href=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/28711305>reluctant to explore their own ideas</a></strong> in the face of ambiguous, ineffective teaching.</p>
						<h3> What do children think about and expect from others? </h3>
						<center><img src="Social.png" alt="Child interacting with other children" width = "333" height = "199"></center>
						<p style ="margin-left:75px">Children not only make decisions about how to spend their own effort, but also have expectations and opinions about the behavior of others. Much like my work has demonstrated that contextual factors, like difficulty, influence children’s own decisions to persist, it has also demonstrated that others’ choices to expend effort influence children’s <strong><a href=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4191060>evaluations of them</a></strong>. In doing this work, I consider whether children apply different standards to their own behavior and to evaluations of others and what kinds of expectations children have for others based on the social groups they belong to. For example, what expectations do children have for others’ engagement in effortful actions and innovation based on their socioeconomic status and gender?</p>
